## Installation

npm i express-handlebars mysql sequelize dotenv bcrypt express-session connect-session-sequelize

## Challenges

Originally beginning this repo my challenge was deploying successfully. When I returned to the repo I tried unsuccessfully to resolve errors. But due to timing I was unable to complete it. I am going to keep working on this beyond my time at Bootcamp. I attempted to save it but for the sake of the end of the bootcamp I opted to submit and return. There are many errors locally and the app is not functional but my hope is to come back to it.
